            <p>
              All our bouquets are hand-arranged, so there can be some little
              differences. <br />
              If local florists won’t have the exact flowers, we’ll offer you to
              replace them with similar flowers.

              Once an order is updated to processing, all details are locked and
              we no longer have any access to make changes. <br />

              The minimum delivery time of the bouquet depends on the city. You
              can see the minimum delivery time by selecting the city and the
              desired bouquet on our website and going to the cart. <br />
              We offer same-day delivery, next-day delivery and delivery on any
              date you like. <br />
              During the holidays (st. Valentine’s Day, Mother's Day, Christmas
              and New Year) the delivery time naturally increases, so we suggest
              to make orders for holidays in advance.

              We have 2 types of delivery from which you can choose: <br />
              <br />
              1. Preliminary call delivery We contact the recipient to reconcile
              convenient delivery time and place. We do not mention flowers
              during the call. <br />
              <br />
              2. You can specify where the florist can leave your order if the
              recipient won’t be available (at the reception, at the neighbors,
              etc).
